## Background

On New Years Eve, I couldn't find a fun clock to watch the countdown so I got bored and created a clock. It was so much fun to build and design I thought it would be fun to create more. This is also just to learn some easy Svelte Kit stuff.

## Clocks

### Clock 1 - Grid

This is the first clock I made. I thought it came out nice and was nice. I based it off a square grid and just had fun filling it in different places.
